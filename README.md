# LinearSVM-for-stroke-prediction

For this project, a Linear Support Vector Machine model was utilized for the purpose of classifying a patient as having either a high or low probability of stroke, given various comorbidity data.

Explanation of feature data (sourced from Kaggle):

* 1) gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
* 2) age: age of the patient
* 3) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
* 4) heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
* 5) ever_married: "No" or "Yes"
* 6) work_type: "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"
* 7) Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
* 8) avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
* 9) bmi: body mass index
* 10) smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"
